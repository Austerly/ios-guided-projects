# User Personas and Interview Practice

Practice going through the User Persona and Interview process with students. These interviews are done _before_ creating high quality mockups, and serve to make sure that the developer identifies key features to build.

### Develop User Personas

Great apps are built for very specific types of users. Discuss what [User Personas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_(user_experience)) are, how to develop them, and how to use them to make decisions for an application.

Discuss one or two applications and discuss their prototypical customers:

* Omnifocus
* Day One
* Sudo
* WalMart
* MyFitnessPal
* Overcast

Who are these apps for? What situations will they run into? What features do they want? What features do they not care about? Could you write a 1-2 page summary of the ideal customer of these applications?

When you are building an app, it is useful to clearly identify your customer, and use that persona when making design decisions in your application.

### User Stories

You should think through the key experiences or User Stories that solve problems for your ideal customers. This is going to help you determine the key features to include in your MVP.

* Write out the user stories
* Group them by features

### Rough Mockups

* Take the grouped features and start drawing out basic mockups
* Iterate, draw each view or feature flow multiple times

### Brainstorm Interview Questions

* Write down an elevator pitch
* Brainstorm 2-3 key questions that will help you as a developer clearly identify the key features of the apps

### Practice Interviewing Eachother

* Introduce yourself
* Give the elevator pitch
* Ask if you can ask a couple of questions to help you improve the app
* Ask the questions, using the notecards as a barebones example of the interface
* If it makes sense, have the interviewee 'use' the interface briefly to solve their problem
