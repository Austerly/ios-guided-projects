# Suggested breakdown for AppleViewControllers

*Start this project from scratch*

1. Show students the final product first so they know what they are working toward. The goal of this project is to be able to get an image either from a device's camera or library, or from the web (by saving the image and then getting it from the device's library), and then share that image using a Mail Composer or Activity Controller.
1. Set up the view in storyboard, explaining your constraints.
2. Everything here will be in the view controller. For each Apple View Controller, have students look at documentation for that controller and then discuss with a partner how it should be used. Then show them how to use it, having them guide you as much as they can. Then have them do it independently, and then come back and do it as a group. The suggested order for doing this is UIImagePicker, MFMailComposer, UIActivityController, SafariViewController.
