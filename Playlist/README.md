# Suggested breakdown for Playlist

*Start this project from scratch*

1. Show students the final product so they know what they are working toward.
2. Set up your views in storyboard.
3. Create your ViewController subclasses and create your outlets and actions.
4. Discuss MVC and why it is important. Plan out the model objects and controllers.
5. Create your `Song` object with its initializer.
6. Create your `Playlist` object with its initializer.
7. Write your `PlaylistController` method signatures.
8. Discuss the singleton pattern and what a shared instance is. Create a shared instance with mock data for `playlists`.
9. Wire up your table view to show the mock data.
10. One at a time, implement your controller functions.
11. Implement your actions in the view controllers to call your `PlaylistController` functions. Be sure to reload your table view when needed.
12. Everyone's app should be working, and they should understand the MVC and Singleton patters.
