# General Guidelines for Guided Projects

* Be aware of the lesson objectives and **_prepare ahead of time_**
* Show students the final product first so that they know what they are working toward.
* The project should be broken into small segments (typically something you can do in less than two minutes on your own, i.e. set up view hierarchy in storyboards, create files for models and controllers, implement model, write function headers for model controllers, etc.). In later units there may be initial setup that students can do more independently.
* Each segment should be completed following the "I do, you do, we do" pattern:
  1. Instructor completes the small segment while students *observe only*
  2. Instructor removes completed portion from the screen and students complete the small segment with the help of documentation and mentor guidance *if necessary*
  3. Instructor completes the small segment for a second time with students watching carefully and ensuring that they completed the task correctly
* Do not be afraid to make slight, temporary deviations from the lesson objectives if there are *fundamental* knowledge gaps that need to be filled. However, be aware of time and whether or not all students need this deviation. If can be better resolved with that individual after the lesson, then do it after.
* Most importantly, **know your stuff, know your students, and care about their success**. Do that and you'll be great.
