# Keynote Mockups

Keynote is a powerful design tool that even teams at Apple use to prototype and mock up ideas for a variety of applications.

Using Keynote, build out a variety of User Interfaces for a simple Chat application.

Watch the Iterative User Interface Design video from WWDC 2016 for more information.

## Instructions

Keep all iterations of the various views for easy comparison.

2. Discuss different potential approaches to the Thread list view
3. Prototype them

Build at least 5 different variations of the Thread list view using student ideas and a variety of other chat interfaces as templates.

#### Thread Detail View / Message List View

1. Build out a Thread Detail View (Message List View)
2. Discuss different potential approaches to the Thread Detail (Message List) view
3. Prototype them

Build at least 5 different variations of the Thread Detail or Message List view using student ideas and a variety of other chat interfaces as templates.

#### Create Keynote Prototype

Using Keynote links, connect the slides together from buttons or other navigation tools. Load the presentation onto the iPhone version of Keynote.

#### Practice User Interviews

Put together a list of specific UX/UI design related questions. Using the prototype and the questions, have the students practice interviews in pairs or small groups. Have them do multiple interviews.
